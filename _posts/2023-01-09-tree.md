# Types of Trees
- A tree has a root node in general.
- A root node has 0 or more child node.
- The child node has also 0 or more child node and it's defined repeatedly.
- A simple definition of a node (GO)
```
type Node struct {
    name        string
    children    []*Node
}
```
- A simple definition of a tree (GO)
```
type Tree struct {
    root        *Node
}
```

## General ree

![General Tree](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200219144238/General-Tree-vs-Binary-Tree.png)   

No constraint is placed on the treeâ€™s hierarchy.

## Binary Tree
![Binary Tree](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Types-of-Trees-in-Data-Structure-2.png)   

Every node has maximum of two children.

## Binary Search Tree
![Binary Search Tree](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Types-of-Trees-in-Data-Structure-3.png)   

> All children on the left <= n < all children on the right   

The above property must be true for all nodes n.

<!--## Balanced Tree-->

## Complete Binary Tree
![CBT](https://www.techiedelight.com/wp-content/uploads/Complete-Binary-Tree.png)

It is a binary tree whose nodes are full at all heights of the tree.   
The last level doesn't have to be full, but the nodes must be filled **from left to right**.

## Full Binary Tree
![FBT](https://www.differencebetween.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DifferenceBetween_Full_Binary_Tree.jpg)

Every node must have exactly **0 or 2** children

## Perfect Binary Tree
![PBT](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220630154756/img2.jpg)

> The number of nodes : 2<sup>k-1</sup>

It is both a balanced tree and full binary tree.   
All leaf nodes have the same height, and the number of nodes at the last level is maximum.

# Binary Tree Traversal

## in-order traversal
> visit left branch -> current node -> right branch  
```
func inOrderTraversal(node *TreeNode) {
    if (node != null) {
        inOrderTraversal(node.left)
        visit(node)
        inOrderTraversal(node.right)
    }
}
```
In the case of a binary search tree, it is visited in ascending order.

## pre-order traversal
> visit current node -> left branch -> right branch  
```
func preOrderTraversal(node *TreeNode) {
    if (node != null) {
        visit(node)
        inOrderTraversal(node.left)
        inOrderTraversal(node.right)
    }
}
```
It always visits the root node first.

## post-order traversal
> visit left branch -> right branch -> current node
```
func postOrderTraversal(node *TreeNode) {
    if (node != null) {
        inOrderTraversal(node.left)
        inOrderTraversal(node.right)
        visit(node)
    }
}
```
It always visits the root node last.
